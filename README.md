This is a demo project, based on __The Open Door__, a short story by Charlotte Riddell.

Born in Carrickfergus, near Belfast, into an Anglo-Irish family, Charlotte Riddell (1832-1906) grew up in Ireland, but moved to London in 1855 after her fatherâ€™s death to pursue a literary career. Initially battling against poverty and the difficulties of breaking into the publishing market as an unknown woman writer, she was later to enjoy success as a novelist and editor, producing a long list of popular novels between the 1860s and 1880s.
